# Assignment-13

## 📌 Overview

This project transforms the simple React-based inventory management system from Assignment 12 into a full-stack
web application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Instead of simulating CRUD operations with a static 
object, the application now performs real create, read, update, and delete operations through a backend API 
connected to a live MongoDB database.

You will build a MongoDB cluster to store product data, create Express API endpoints to manage that data, and 
update the React front end to interact with these endpoints. The final result is a modern full-stack product 
management dashboard that demonstrates your ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies into a 
functioning application.
